## Introduction

The C programming language is a powerful tool for software development. This repository focuses on a project-based approach, allowing you to learn C by building real applications. Each project includes clear instructions, code examples, and explanations of the underlying concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/LatifkhonRavshanov/C-From-the-Ground-Up---A-Project-Based-Approach/releases) to download the latest version of the project files. After downloading, extract the files and follow the instructions in the README file included in each project folder.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the projects, ensure you have the following installed:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks)
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each containing a different project. Each project folder includes:

- `README.md`: Instructions and project details.
- `src/`: Source code files.
- `tests/`: Test files (if applicable).
- `docs/`: Documentation and resources.
